# Diagnosing-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Using-Deep-Learning
Deep learning project aimed at early detection of diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness in diabetic patients. By employing transfer learning, I have integrated five pre-trained models - VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 - to make accurate predictions on a custom dataset created for this purpose.

## Key Features
Transfer Learning Expertise: Utilizing state-of-the-art pre-trained models for robust and accurate predictions.  

Custom Dataset: A meticulously curated dataset ensures the models are trained on diverse and real-world diabetic retinopathy cases.
