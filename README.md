# Diagnosing-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Using-Deep-Learning
Deep learning project designed to assist in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness in diabetic patients. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, this project employs five distinct pre-trained models on a custom dataset, offering accurate and efficient predictions for diabetic retinopathy severity.
